## wordl, a Wordle replica

#### JD D'Annunzio

Hello everyone! Welcome to my project for the second term of Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development course.

#### Purpose

This project is intended to replicate the structure and basic features of Wordle, an existing word-guessing game found **[here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)**.

#### Features

*Note: I will endeavor to keep these line addresses current with future changes, but they ~~should remain at least relatively close to their present locations~~ have moved drastically from their original positions.*

I have implemented the following features:

- Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app

    - script.js, const init, line 91

- Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

    - script.js, const init, line 95

- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format

    - script.js, function handleKeyPress, line 155

- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

    - script.js, const init, line 97 

#### Notes

This is a vanilla JS project. It was written in VSCode with the Live Server extension and tested primarily in Google Chrome with some iOS/Safari testing.
