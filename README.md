### wordl, a Wordle replica

##### JD D'Annunzio

Hello everyone! Welcome to my project for the second term of Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development course.

##### Purpose

This project is intended to replicate the structure and basic features of Wordle, an existing word-guessing game found **[here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)**.

##### Features

I have implemented the following features:

- Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app

- Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format

- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
